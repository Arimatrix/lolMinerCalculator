Executable to Calculate The Shares and Total Time Mined by a worker in lolMiner <br />

As the title suggests, this application calculates the total shares and total time mined by each worker in lolminer for Ethereum Mining (might work for other cryptos too , haven't checked). You'll need to enabled logging in lolMiner for this to work. I have tested this on version 1.28a. Will update this if there are major changes in newer lolminer versions.
